## Regarding Chaotic and related IP
This game is created and distributed without any affiliation to companies or organizations which own or have rights to Chaotic intelectual property. It is safe to assume that any contributions made to this project are done out of love for the game and not due to any existing or previous affiliation with any company or organization which own or have rights to Chaotic intelectual property.

This is a fan-made and run project and is distributed without any expectation of profit from any source. This means I will not ask for donations or payment for the game. The only exception I foresee is if the burden of server payment somehow becomes too great.

If you would like to donate, please instead donate to the [Fight to Repair 501c4](https://fighttorepair.org/donate/501c4/) as that's where I would personally redirect any donations which are provided to this project. This 501c4 has no affliliation with any company or organization which own or have rights to Chaotic intelectual property. It is simply part of a movement which I have a deep fondness for.

NOTE: This project is *very* much in the early stages and will not be playable for a long time. If you would like to contribute, please reach out to me on the [Chaotic Discord](https://discord.gg/chaotic) (username brainard50#3809)
